    /// own saves (slots 0-3) ever being touched.

    /// The in-memory half of that pipeline - SerializeInMemorySave on the host and the
    /// CSaveLoad.m_SavedGame injection in ApplyAndLoad - is an approach contributed by

    /// actually needed:
    ///  - HOST (BuildHostPayload): not "is this Steam" but "is the in-memory world CURRENT".

    ///    still wins when there is one; the counter is what makes the in-memory fallback safe
    ///    when there isn't.

    ///    no-op on the local-file backend (CGameManager.LoadData's first act is
